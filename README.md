# DeepFit Clone

---

## About this repository
The original [DeepFit](https://github.com/namanarora42/DeepFit) project tracks your body movements throughout a workout. It will help correct for posture, keep track of your reps and make sure you get fit the right way. 

This project clone repository was created as an aptitude test of sorts to test my knowledge of Python programming and working with machine learning libraries.

This [README.md](/README.md) file will feature a checklist to keep track of this projects status and an explanation to the approach taken to learn about the tools employed.

## The Approach
In order to learn as much as possible from this project, I intend to tackle as few libraries at a time. Starting by building an AI based Pose Estimation program using the MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries that uses a webcam feed to render results of different poses on the screen. 

After building this program, I will then advance to building the DeepFit project using my enhanced understanding of the component libraries. 

The program will be written in Python using the Jupyter Notebook  environment and will be comprehensive in its documentation for future reference. 

The logs for this project will be maintained in the [logs.md](log.md) file.
