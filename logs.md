1. Created [this](https://github.com/0xVolt/deepfit-esque) repository to host all the programs relevant to this project. ![](assets/26-07-22/1.png)
2. Wrote the [`README.md`](/README.md) file for this project describing its purpose and the tasks to accomplish. ![](/assets/26-07-22/2.png) ![](assets/26-07-22/3.png)
3. Started the [`logs.md`](logs.md) log file to log the daily progress made on this project.  ![](/assets/26-07-22/4.png)
4. Began the sub-project on pose estimation using MediaPipe and OpenCV. All the code is in the [`pose-estimation.ipynb`](pose-estimation.ipynb) notebook. The last part of the pose estimation program, i.e., building a bicep curl counter, remains to be implemented. This is what has been implemented so far. ![](assets/26-07-22/5.png) ![](assets/26-07-22/6.png) ![](assets/26-07-22/7.png) ![](assets/26-07-22/8.png) ![](assets/26-07-22/9.png) ![](assets/26-07-22/10.png) ![](assets/26-07-22/11.png) ![](assets/26-07-22/12.png) ![](assets/26-07-22/13.png) ![](assets/26-07-22/14.png)
